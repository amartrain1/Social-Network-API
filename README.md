## Description
This application is a blog-style social media site.

## Installation
The user must run `npm i` to install express.js and mongoose. 

## Usage
After the user runs `npm i`, they must run `npm run seed` in order to seed the database. If there is no data, this will simply set up the database and fill it with the preset data inside of `utils/data.js`. If there is already data in the database, this will clear all current data and reseed it with the preset data inside of `utils/data.js`. Once the seeding process is completed, the user will see a message that says "Seeded" in the console. Then, run `npm start` to open your localhost port and navigate the database, using all of the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes. The following link will direct you to a Youtube video demonstrating how to use this application.
